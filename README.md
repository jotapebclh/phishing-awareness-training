## 🔍 2. How to identify it?  
To ensure the organization’s security, it is crucial to carefully check for signs when receiving an unknown or suspicious e-mail.  

Keep in mind that many phishing attempts use **real company names, job titles, and even legitimate-looking e-mail addresses** to make the fraud more convincing.  

⚠️ Therefore, when analyzing a suspicious e-mail, remember to:  
- Check the **sender’s e-mail address** for unusual or meaningless details;  
- Verify the **domain** and watch for fraudulent variations, such as `@go0gle` instead of `@google`;  
- Look for **spelling or translation errors**;  
- Assess what is being requested (e.g., personal data, credentials, or sensitive information);  
- Be cautious with **attachments or links**;  
- In case of doubt, contact the supposed sender through a **different communication channel** to confirm authenticity.
